    information with the logistics service provider to arrange delivery or arrange partners to provide services. We will
    only share your personal information for lawful, legitimate, necessary, specific and definite purposes, and only

    male in Beijing likes software development") to help them understand their audience or customers.</p>

    from unauthorized access, public disclosure, use, modification, damage or loss. We will take all reasonable and
    feasible measures to protect your personal information. For example, when you visit Xiaomi's account, you can choose
    our two-step verification program to ensure better security. When you send or receive information from a meter home
    device to our server, we ensure that it is encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and other algorithms. We will
    use trusted protection mechanisms to prevent malicious attacks on data. We will deploy access control mechanisms to
    ensure that only authorized personnel can access personal information. And we will hold security and privacy
    protection training courses to enhance employees' awareness of the importance of protecting personal information.
  </p>
  <p>(2) We promise that employees and third-party service providers who provide products and services to you through
    access to this information have strict contractual confidentiality obligations. If they fail to fulfill these
    obligations, they will be subject to disciplinary action or termination of cooperation. Similarly, we have special
    access control measures for cloud-based data storage. In summary, we regularly review information collection,
    storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent any unauthorized access and use.
  </p>
  <p>(3) At the same time, all your personal information is stored on a secure server and protected in controlled
    facilities. We classify your data according to its importance and sensitivity, and ensure that your personal
    information has the highest security level.</p>
  <p>(4) We will take all reasonable and feasible measures to ensure that irrelevant personal information is not
    collected. We will only retain your personal information for the period required to achieve the purposes stated in
    the cost policy, unless the retention period needs to be extended or permitted by law. When it is no longer
    necessary to retain information for legal, dispute resolution, enforcement of our agreement or other commercial
    purposes, we will no longer retain personal information or eliminate ways to associate personal information with
    specific individuals.</p>
